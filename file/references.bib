   abstract = {Extension concept mapping is a technique to connect prior existing concept maps with new knowledge structures. It offers advantages in each stage of the knowledge-integrating process and encourages learners to improve their performance. While previous studies have confirmed that the extended kit-build concept map outperformed the extended scratch-build approach in terms of comprehension test scores and map size, they have yet to evaluate the quality of concept maps and students' perceptions. Although the size of the concept map components could represent the breadth of personal knowledge, it does not constantly describe the good knowledge structure. In addition, the student's degree of acceptance after the concept mapping demonstrates their intention to use systems in the future. The present study aims to compare the effect of extended scratch-build and extended kit-build on the students' quality of knowledge structures and perceptions. Fifty-five second-year university students were involved and divided into two groups: control and experimental. The control group utilized the extended scratch-build map, while the experimental group used the extended kit-build concept mapping tool. Quality of propositions and structural map scores as learning outcomes were used to measure the students' knowledge structures. The possibility of a relationship between quality scores was expressed using the Spearman correlation. This study involved the Technology Acceptance Model to confirm the students' perceptions of extension concept mapping tools. The perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention constructs were used to investigate users' intentions. The findings suggest that the quality of propositions and structural map scores in the experimental group were significantly higher than in the control group. This study also found that the extended kit-build method achieved better perceptions scores than the extended scratch-build.},

abstract = {Improving learning strategies through digital technology could contribute to educational enhancement. Concept mapping, as one example of prevailing learning strategies, has been known to be effective in supporting learning and teaching. Previous studies have demonstrated how concept maps could benefit learning. Despite the positive effects of concept maps and concept mapping on students’ learning performance, several studies have suggested that students struggled to enhance their understanding through concept map composition due to a lack of relevant understanding and prior knowledge of a particular learning topic. The role of the teacher as instructor remains important to exploit the potential of concept maps in their teaching and learning activities optimally. Thus, expect improvement in the students’ learning performance. This study reviewed how Kit-Build as a learning strategy could help students improve their understanding through the concept map recomposition activity. An in-lecture experiment with undergraduate students was conducted to experience several learning strategies as an activity to support their learning during the class. According to their acquaintances, the benefits and drawbacks of using Kit-Build and other strategies were investigated. The results suggested that Kit-Build concept map is the preferred learning strategy to support efficient and meaningful learning for students.},

Kit-Build concept map is a learning framework that incorporated concept map recomposition as its essential activity. It has been used to learn English as a Foreign Language (EFL) reading comprehension. Students learn through recomposing digital concept maps from a set of teacher's concept map components; hence, the teacher's concept map is essential in Kit-Build. A teacher's concept map should reflect the learning context and strategy, the teacher's purpose and intention, students' understanding level, and focus questions. However, automatic-generated concept maps with Concept Map Mining (CMM) can only produce general concept maps that are not fit and difficult to correspond to said reasons. As teacher's concept maps are essential in learning with Kit-Build, improving teachers' productivity in composing concept maps of a particular learning material becomes necessary. This study proposed a semi-automatic concept map generation approach of EFL reading comprehension texts with CMM to assist teachers composed their concept maps. The proposed concept map generation approach was integrated into the current Kit-Build concept map authoring tool as an authoring support feature. The accuracy of the support feature in generating concept map components is presented in this research. The result suggested that the proposed authoring support tool is better used to refine a concept map.},

abstract = {A learning process can be facilitated by the interaction and participation of students in its activities. However, the barrier of direct learning activity due to the global pandemic COVID-19 situation significantly decreases students’ engagement and understanding of learning materials. The situation challenges educators to keep the pace of achieving the expected learning outcomes by creating effective distance learning environments and methods. Facilitating students with collaborative tasks is one known practical approach to enhance students’ learning outcomes due to its opportunity to allow students to exchange their perspectives and understanding. An online collaborative learning system of Kit-Build concept map has been designed and developed to remove the barrier of offline interaction among students with concept maps. An experiment was conducted to explore how the students would experience the collaboration while using the online collaborative Kit-Build concept system to learn and comprehend a reading material. The result suggested that students who use Kit-Build concept map could structure their knowledge and understand more efficiently. They also managed to have better strategies in composing concept maps collaboratively and understand the learning material more efficiently through discussion. The system and the Kit-Build concept map method could help students monitor and manage their collaborative work better than the traditional open-ended concept mapping strategy. Thus, using Kit-Build concept map to learn collaboratively with concept maps becomes the recommended strategy in distance learning.},

   abstract = {This research, to design and develop a concept map authoring support tool, adopts a semi-automatic concept mapping approach to help teachers create concept maps from English readings. A concept map is widely regarded as a useful teaching and learning tool. It offers many potential advantages apart from representing the students’ knowledge and understanding during learning. Students’ engagement in using and creating concept maps with a computer-enabled concept mapping tool raises concept maps’ potential benefits. It contributes to the learning process and improves the students’ meaningful learning. The Kit-Build concept map framework, which incorporates a technology-enabled concept mapping tool, uses concept map recomposition as its essential learning activity. In learning with Kit-Build, teachers compose concept maps that they want the students to achieve. The teachers’ maps are then decomposed into components from which the students recompose and reflect deeply on their understanding. The difference between teacher’s and students’ concept maps depicts the gap between teachers’ expected understanding and students’ actual understanding. Hence, the teachers’ concept map becomes an essential part of learning with Kit-Build. For some teachers, creating a good concept map for learning is difficult and time-consuming. Hence, support to improve teachers’ productivity in creating concept maps is essential. The findings suggest that the support tool yields better concept mapping efficiency while maintaining concept maps of similar quality. Teachers also found that the support tool was useful. Therefore, semi-automatic concept mapping with the supported Kit-Build concept map authoring tool has been shown to be a better approach.},

Sophisticating innovations in educational technologies are highly required to overcome change. Delivering digital content and activities in a distance learning environment has potential advantages in improving the students' engagement in learning. Concept mapping is known to support students' learning process and help them learn better. A concept mapping authoring tool built to support learning with the Kit-Build concept map framework has been developed to incorporate computer technologies into digital concept mapping activities. This research investigates to what extent the students' technology adoption towards the Kit-Build concept map authoring tool as a digital concept mapping tool supports the students to learn English reading comprehension. This research incorporates the Technology Acceptance Model to evaluate students' acceptance towards the tool and uses three external variables, i.e., compatibility, habit, and enjoyment for the TAM model. Most of the result presented in this research is consistent with the original TAM study. Furthermore, compatibility and enjoyment are also identified to significantly affect the students' adoption of the Kit-Build concept map authoring tool.},

abstract = {A map-based application is, by and large, useful to search for information about locations or places. The application, such as Google Maps, provides commuting or navigation information of a particular place. With the mobile version of Google Maps, people can get such information directly from their mobile devices. Google also has a directions interface that supports finding a navigational path between two specified locations. In recognizing an area surrounding the path, there is an algorithm to support that functionality, namely RouteBoxer. The recognized surrounding area can be utilized further by the application to identify places nearby. In finding a path's surrounding area, the RouteBoxer algorithm defines a grid of rectangles that cover the whole path and marks rectangles nearby by traversing the path. However, the algorithm's computational performance becomes unacceptably slow when the path contains many path points. The RouteBoxer algorithm accepts a collection of geolocation points to represent the path and a user-specified distance away from the path to identify the area surrounding the path. This research measures the algorithm performance while incorporating the Douglas-Peucker line simplification algorithm to reduce the number of points processed by the RouteBoxer algorithm, hence improve its processing performance. An experiment shows that the path simplification process reduces up to 99% points of a path, improves the original RouteBoxer calculation performance up to 87.8 times faster, and maintains its precision above 92.6%.},

However, their popularity is reduced by the availability of wide variety of more modern and online public transportations. One of the obstacles commonly faced by passengers of mikrolet is the limited information about the routes taken by mikrolet. In this paper, we proposed a prototype of service that can generate trip planning by mikrolet. We use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm as the basis to build our solution because it is relatively simple to modify. The service for trip planning available through REST web service and utilize location-based service style. Based on functionality testing result, the proposed system successfully generate all trip plans as expected. From performance perspective, when the number of routes and plans increased, the overall system performance degrades, so in the future the proposed prototype and its algorithm may needs further optimization.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;},

  abstractNote={Sentiment analysis is a research study that aims to extract subjectivity of opinions. Due to massive growth number of user generated content in social media, Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging application which user is freely to discuss and share opinions about specific topic or entity. Twitter have several features that potentially can be used to improve sentiment analysis such as like and retweet. Like and retweet are mechanism in Twitter to propagate or share and to show appreciation of other user posting. This paper proposes a combination of textual and non-textual features to improve performance of sentiment prediction. In this research we apply Naïve Bayes for textual classification and Fisher Score to determine non-textual (like and retweet) features. By combining two kinds of features, our experimental find the optimal value of α and β. The evaluation performance using F1-measure gives 0.838 of accuracy with α and β are 0.6 and 0.4 respectively.},

  abstractNote={Mobile based culinary recommendation system has become critical topic in mobile application. Some methods presented in the literature propose the use of the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), AHP TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and fuzzy AHP for mobile based culinary recommendation system. However, there are no comparative studies of these three methods when applied to mobile based culinary recommendation system. Thus, this research presents a comparative analysis of these three methods in the context of culinary recommendation system in mobile environment. The comparison was made based on accuracy and time complexity because mobile application environment needs low time complexity. The results have shown that all of these methods are suitable for culinary recommendation system in mobile environment. Fuzzy AHP have the highest accuracy between all of these methods, it have 66,67 % accuracy. But, AHP TOPSIS shows the best performance in time complexity, with order of growth in quadratic class (n2)},

The availability of information technology that supports public transportation in Malang city is still limited. An effort is required to encourage the availability of information technology that support public transportation in Malang city. This research attempts to propose a draft proposal of REST API designed for supporting information about public transportation services in Malang city. The result of this research showed that the REST API should provide a search facility to find proper service mode of transportation, cost estimation, time estimation, calling or booking a public transportation, a list of all the modes of transportation that exist, as well as detailed information on a mode of transport in which includes the name of public transportation, index of comfortability, index of security, index of safety, index of privacy, index of availability, index of accessibility index, and route.&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;CM18&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Keywords: &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;Transportation, Public Transportation, API, REST, Service-Oriented Architecture, Web Service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract = {Twitter currently is one of the leading social networks worldwide based on the amount of monthly active users after Facebook and Instagram. People uses Twitter mostly to find out more information about breaking news or keeping up with news in general by following trending topics. As Twitter become a source of news breaks contents in form of comments and replies to share the newest ideas. Therefore, several mobile applications that utilize Twitter API has been developed to provide a convenient way in providing trending topics to their user. Twitter trending topics offers an effective opportunity in marketing point of view for online marketers to promote their marketing contents. Spam contents in Twitter were found to be distracting and annoying for certain users, thus mobile application to deliver spam-free Twitter trending topics contents is needed. This research designs an Android application framework that allow developers to build their own implementation of spam detection classifier for Twitter contents as application library. This research implements two classification methods, i.e. Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor, to identify spam in Twitter trending topics. The Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor classification methods are able to detect spam and ham contents with 82% and 71% accuracy respectively.},

abstract="Improving the quality of the concept map affects the activation of Higher-Order Thinking. Various methods for manually evaluating the quality of concept maps have been developed. However, these methods can consume a substantial amount of time and burden teachers with a heavy workload. The Kit-Build concept map is a framework for learning that enables the automatic evaluation of concept maps. The prior study has proven that raising the concept map quality using the Kit-Build concept map affects learning achievement. However, the effect has yet to be investigated on Higher-Order Thinking activation. This study aimed to investigate the influence of the enhancement of concept map quality on Higher-Order Thinking stimulation in the Kit-Build concept map. The Higher-Order Thinking activation was measured from the student's performance in solving the Higher-Order Thinking questions. This study also evaluated the validity of the concept map automated assessment in the Kit-Build concept map by comparing the assessment results of the method with the assessment results of the manual method. This study's results suggested that improving the quality of concept maps by using the Kit-Build concept map could activate Higher-Order Thinking. The findings also showed that the automated assessment in the Kit-Build concept map was a promising tool that could be utilized to assess the quality of concept maps.",

abstract="The Mind Map (MM) is a thinking tool that represents understanding diagrammatically, and its creation and use by oneself or by sharing with others are accepted as useful activities. Understanding the map creator's understanding represented in MM is an essential activity in such situations. In this study, the promotion of the understanding of MM has been investigated. As a method of promotion, a recomposition method successfully used for the concept map is adopted. If the conventional recomposition method is applied to MM, a complete decomposition of MM is performed (Full Recomposition method: FR). In addition to FR, we have proposed a method in which only the leaves of MM are recomposed by the students (Leaves Recomposition method: LR). LR reduces the cognitive load in the recomposition but it is expected to keep the learning effect because recomposing a leaf requires an understanding of the path from the root to the leaf. In this paper, we conducted comparative experiments between FR and LR. The results of pre-tests and post-tests showed that both methods significantly increased the test scores and there was no significant difference between FR and LR. Then, the growth rates of map scores for LR were much higher than those of FR, and the results of the questionnaire suggested that LR was an easier way to recompose MM. These results suggest that (1) the recomposition of MM has a learning effect, and (2) LR can reduce the cognitive load of recomposition while keeping the learning effect.",
